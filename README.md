# What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source system developed by Google, now overseen by the CNCF. It simplifies container orchestration. Thus, developers can build apps without dealing with infrastructure complexities. This system provides container management and scheduling. Users can dictate application behaviors within a cluster.
